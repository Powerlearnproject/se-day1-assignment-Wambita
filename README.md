#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of systematic engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It ensures that software is efficient, scalable, reliable, and maintainable.

Importance in the Technology Industry:

- Ensures Quality: Helps in building high-performance and bug-free software.
- Scalability: Supports growing user needs and business expansion.
- Security: Protects applications from cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Reduces development costs through well-defined processes.
- User-Centric Approach: Ensures software meets user needs effectively.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference:
        Addressed the "software crisis" caused by poor development practices.
        Introduced structured programming and formal methodologies.

- Agile Manifesto (2001):
        Shifted focus from rigid development models (like Waterfall) to flexible, iterative methods.
        Prioritized collaboration, continuous feedback, and adaptability.

- Cloud Computing & DevOps (2010s - Present):
        Enabled remote hosting, scalability, and faster software delivery.
        DevOps practices improved collaboration between development and operations teams.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: Define project scope, goals, budget, and timeline.

2. Requirements Analysis: Gather user needs and document functional and non-functional requirements.

3. Design: Create system architecture, UI/UX design, and database structure.

4. Development: Write, implement, and integrate code based on design specifications.

5. Testing: Conduct unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing to ensure quality.

6. Deployment:Release software to production or end users.

7. Maintenance & Updates: Fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features based on feedback.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Waterfall follows a sequential approach, where each phase is completed before moving to the next. In contrast, Agile follows an iterative approach, allowing for continuous adjustments throughout the development process.

2. Waterfall has rigid, predefined phases, meaning changes are difficult to implement once development starts. Agile is flexible and adaptable, enabling teams to modify requirements as needed.

3. Testing in Waterfall is conducted after development is complete, whereas Agile incorporates continuous testing throughout the project lifecycle.

4. Waterfall relies on heavy documentation to guide development, while Agile prioritizes working software and frequent iterations over extensive documentation.

5. Waterfall is best suited for large, well-defined projects, such as government systems, where requirements are stable and do not change frequently. Agile is ideal for fast-changing projects, such as startups or mobile apps, where user feedback and feature updates play a crucial role.

A banking system is an example of a project that would benefit from Waterfall due to its fixed requirements and high security needs. On the other hand, a social media app is well-suited for Agile, as it requires continuous improvements based on user engagement and trends.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer:
    - Writes, tests, and maintains code.
    - Implements new features and fixes bugs.

- Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:

    - Ensures software meets quality standards.
    - Conducts manual and automated testing.

- Project Manager:

    - Manages timelines, budgets, and resources.
    - Ensures smooth collaboration between teams.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1. IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):

    - Provide a user-friendly interface for coding, debugging, and testing.
    - Examples: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.

2. VCS (Version Control Systems):

    - Track code changes, enable collaboration, and manage different versions.
    - Examples: Git (with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), SVN.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Scope Creep (changing project requirements) - Use agile and set clear initial requirements

2. Technical Debt (quick fixes that lead to poor code) - Follow best coding practices and conduct regular refactoring.

3. Team collaboration issues - Use Communication tools like slack, jira or trello

4. Security vulnerabilities - Implement secure coding practices and conduct regular security audits.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit Testing:
    - Tests individual components or functions.
    - Ensures correctness at the smallest level.

- Integration Testing:
    - Verifies interactions between modules.
    - Example: Checking API calls between a frontend and backend.

- System Testing:
    - Tests the complete software as a whole.
    - Example: Checking if an entire e-commerce website functions correctly.

- Acceptance Testing:
    - Ensures software meets user expectations.
    - Example: A client tests an app before approving deployment.

Importance:
    -  Detects and fixes bugs early, 
    -   improves software reliability


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
rompt engineering is the practice of designing effective input queries to obtain accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses from AI models like ChatGPT.

- **Enhances response quality** – Well-structured prompts improve AI-generated answers, making them more accurate and relevant.  
- **Reduces ambiguity** – Clear prompts help AI interpret user intent correctly, avoiding vague or misleading responses.  
- **Optimizes AI performance** – Properly crafted prompts improve efficiency and minimize irrelevant outputs.  
- **Improves user interaction** – Enables more meaningful and actionable responses in chatbots, automation, and content generation.  
- **Reduces biases** – Well-defined prompts help guide AI towards balanced and objective outputs.  
- **Increases productivity** – AI delivers precise insights, saving time in industries like healthcare, finance, and customer support.  
- **Essential for AI-driven applications** – Used in chatbots, data analysis, virtual assistants, and software development.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about Python."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain Python as a programming language, including its key features, popular frameworks, and common applications in web development and data science."

 Why is the improved prompt better?

More specific: Defines what aspects of Python to cover.
Focused on relevant use cases: AI will generate a targeted and useful response.
